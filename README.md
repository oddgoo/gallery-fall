# GALLERY GLITCH

![Gallery Glitch screenshot](/static/images/meta/screenshot.png?raw=true)

I made a scavenger hunt for my birthday that took place at the Art Gallery of NSW (Naala Badu, North building).

The game happened in early Feb, 2025, and involves not only the artworks, but observing and playing with the amazing space and architecture.

It can still be played and accessed at:
https://gallery-fall.vercel.app/

Tho I estimate that every week, as the gallery changes, 1 or 2 puzzles will stop working.

PS: There is nothing that requires breaching the actual Museum rules :P

## Technical details

Built with SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.
Works as a static site.

I used pnpm as a package manager, but others should work too.

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
pnpm build
```

Note: As this was done rather hastily and with a fair amount of AI help, a lot of the code itself may be unnecesarily complex.
